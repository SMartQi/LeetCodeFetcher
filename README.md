# LeetCodeFetcher
Here is a LeetCode submission fetching and saving tool that helps you save your submissions.

You need to get your own LeetCode website cookie (You may get it from a network requests inspector) as a parameter.

This python file will fetch your LeetCode submissions and save all AC ones. It also automatically add and commit those changes.

[This](https://github.com/SMartQi/LeetCode) is my repo generated from this program.
